http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html[React] is a javascript library for building UI's. It's a different
approach, usually people use templates. With react, you work with javascript objects. I think is a good idea, but,
it's better to do similar implementation using grooscript.


I wrote this link:nodejs_example.html[guide] where I created a DSL on top of Node.js using traits. Now I'm going to use
AST's and groovy beans. Use the groovy features in the browser, is the main reason to use grooscript.

So let's create reactive objects as react.js does, in a TO-DO sample application:

image::todo.png[Result]

=== In javascript, from react.js page

[source,javascript]
--
var TodoList = React.createClass({displayName: 'TodoList',
  render: function() {
    var createItem = function(itemText) {
      return React.DOM.li(null, itemText);
    };
    return React.DOM.ul(null, this.props.items.map(createItem));
  }
});
var TodoApp = React.createClass({displayName: 'TodoApp',
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {items: [], text: ''};
  },
  onChange: function(e) {
    this.setState({text: e.target.value});
  },
  handleSubmit: function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    var nextItems = this.state.items.concat([this.state.text]);
    var nextText = '';
    this.setState({items: nextItems, text: nextText});
  },
  render: function() {
    return (
      React.DOM.div(null,
        React.DOM.h3(null, "TODO"),
        TodoList({items: this.state.items}),
        React.DOM.form({onSubmit: this.handleSubmit},
          React.DOM.input({onChange: this.onChange, value: this.state.text}),
          React.DOM.button(null, 'Add #' + (this.state.items.length + 1))
        )
      )
    );
  }
});
React.renderComponent(TodoApp(null), mountNode);
--

=== In groovy, my implementation

[source,groovy]
--
include::{sourcesDir}/react/TodoApp.groovy[]
--
<1> AST that do all react job.
<2> List of all TODO's added.
<3> New TODO that is being typed in the text input.
<4> Initialization of the component.
<5> React on any change in the input text.
<6> On 'Add TODO' click.
<7> Html dsl that renders the component.

For the execution in javascript, I have used this groovy script (react.groovy):

[source,groovy]
--
include::{sourcesDir}/react.groovy[]
--
<1> Little helper class that comes with grooscript to do some jQuery stuff.
<2> Call init function in the component.
<3> Set the selector where draw the component.
<4> Start the component.
<5> Call the function to render the component on load the page.

=== Advantages

* You can create your own framework / libraries, that perfect fit with your application.
* You write groovy code and test it with https://code.google.com/p/spock/[spock] or your favorite java / groovy testing framework.
* You don't have to do functional tests, you can test all with unit tests and mock javascript / jquery.
* You write the render code as a DSL, using groovy code, very powerful.
* You can use traits, AST's, a little of inheritance, DSL's, a bit of meta-programming,... and a lot of groovy magic in your application.
* You don't have to use any pre-processor as react.js does, just converting the code to javascript applies the AST's.

=== Implementation

The code is implemented as part of the grooscript-demos project on https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript-demos[github], and you
can see in action in grooscript http://grooscript.org[homepage]. Just with grooscript I convert `TodoApp.groovy` and `react.groovy` files
to javascript and add them with `grooscript.js`, `grooscript-tools.js` and `jquery.js` to html:

[source,html]
--
include::{webDir}/react.html[]
--

You can take a look at the source code on https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript-demos/tree/master/src/main/groovy/react[Github]

=== Conclusion

Implement things in http://groovy-lang.org/[groovy] is a pleasure, and now, with grooscript, you can create nice pieces
of code that will run smooth in your browser. This is just a suggestion, loads of new ideas can be created
in the browser or node.js using groovy and grooscript.

Please, if you have comments, suggestions, problems,... don't hesitate to contact me at grooscript@gmail.com, or open
an issue or feature in http://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript/issues?state=open[Github]. More guides come in the
future, also can find more documentation in http://grooscript.org[grooscript] site.
